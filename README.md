## EU27-Tobacco-consumption-analysis-after-Tobacco-Product-Directive


**INITIATIVE**

With 27% of all cancers attributed to its use, tobacco is the single largest avoidable health risk in the EU. Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, a key pillar of the European Health Union aims at creating a ‘Tobacco-free Generation', where less than 5% of people use tobacco by 2040. To reach this highly ambitious goal a whole available arsenal of tobacco control tools at all levels needed to be mobilized.

**BACKGROUND**

Adopted in 2014, and applicable for most of its provision as of May 2016, the Tobacco Products Directive 2014/40/EU concerns the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products and aims at facilitating smooth functioning of the internal market, protecting people's health – particularly of the youth – and meeting the EU obligations under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC).
